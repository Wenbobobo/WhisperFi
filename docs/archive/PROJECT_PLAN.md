# Project Plan: Private DeFi Solution

This document tracks the progress of the project, from initial conception to prototype development.

## Phase 1: Discovery, Strategy, and Specification

**Status:** In Progress

**Objective:** Define the precise problem, target market, technical solution, and product specifications.

**Key Tasks:**

- [ ] Initial document review and analysis.
- [ ] Foundational Socratic questioning and debate.
- [ ] Target Customer Profile Definition.
- [ ] Competitive Analysis (Technical & Market).
- [x] Technical Solution Options & Trade-off Analysis:
  - [x] **Debate and Document:** Relayer Pool (Plan A) vs. AA Wallets (Plan B).
    - [x] Analyze and quantify the anonymity set of each model.
    - [x] Estimate and compare the end-to-end gas costs for a typical transaction (e.g., Uniswap V3 swap).
    - [x] Compare the practical MEV-resistance of each model (e.g., private order flow vs. public UserOp mempool).
  - [x] **Decision:** The target architecture is **Plan A: A sophisticated, MEV-aware Relayer network executing trades from a managed pool of addresses.** This decision is based on superior anonymity, lower gas costs, and fundamentally better MEV-resistance for our target users. AA will be considered as a potential secondary feature, not the core architecture.
- [ ] Finalized Product Specification Document.
- [ ] Detailed Technical Architecture Document.

## Phase 2: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

**Status:** Not Started

**Objective:** Create comprehensive documentation for new team members and for the open-source community.

**Key Tasks:**

- [ ] Develop "Zero-to-Hero" guide on Zero-Knowledge proofs in the context of this project.
- [ ] Develop "Zero-to-Hero" guide on Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) and its application in our solution.
- [ ] Write user-facing documentation for the prototype.

## Phase 3: Implementation and Verification

**Status:** Not Started

**Objective:** Build a functional prototype based on the specifications from Phase 1.

**Key Tasks:**

- [ ] Set up development environment (Hardhat, Circom, etc.).
- [ ] Implement ZK circuits.
- [ ] Implement smart contracts (PrivacyPool, Verifier, Account Abstraction modules).
- [ ] Build off-chain client/SDK for interaction.
- [ ] Develop and run comprehensive test suite.
- [ ] Deploy prototype to a testnet.
